Contribution
============

Contributions are essential to the success of open source projects, but are by
no means limited to contributing code. Much more can be done, for example by
improving `documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/p/web-vision/wv_deepltranslate/main/en-us/>`__.

Contribution workflow
---------------------

#.  Please always create an issue on `Github <https://github.com/web-vision/wv_deepltranslate/issues>`__
    before starting a change. This is very helpful to understand what kind of issue
    the pull request will solve and if your change will be accepted.

#.  Bug fixes: Please describe the type of bug you want to fix and provide
    feedback on how to reproduce the problem. We will only accept bug fixes if we
    can reproduce the problem.

#.  Features: Not every feature is relevant to the majority of the users.
    In addition: We do not want to make this extension more complicated in usability
    for a marginal feature. It helps to have a discussion about a new feature before
    opening a pull request.

#.  Please always create a pull request based on the updated release branch. That
    ensures that necessary quality checks and tests are executed as a quality
    raiser.
